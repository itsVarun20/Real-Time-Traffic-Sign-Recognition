# Real Time Traffic Sign Recognition

Project Domain: Computer Vision

This repository contains the dataset, code, and web application for real-time traffic sign recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and OpenCV.

## Overview

This project focuses on recognizing traffic signs in real-time using images from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). The goal is to develop a robust CNN model for accurate traffic sign classification and integrate it into a web application using Flask.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB), stored in the `data` folder.

## Technologies Used

* *Keras:* For building and training the convolutional neural network
* *OpenCV (cv2):* For image processing and real-time video capture
* *Flask:* For web application integration
* *HTML and CSS:* For web pages creation and styling

## Repository Structure

* `data/`: Contains the German traffic sign images dataset.
