![TSR2](https://github.com/itsVarun20/Real-Time-Traffic-Sign-Recognition/assets/107756380/64d05a9f-36f8-4d95-ace3-b573bf38b4c3)

Project Domain: Computer Vision

This repository contains the dataset, code, and web application for real-time traffic sign recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and OpenCV.

## Overview

This project focuses on recognizing traffic signs in real-time using images from the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). The goal is to develop a robust CNN model for accurate traffic sign classification and integrate it into a web application using Flask.

Dataset: The dataset used in this project is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). URL: https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/

## Technologies Used

* *Keras:* For building and training the convolutional neural network
* *OpenCV (cv2):* For image processing and real-time video capture
* *Flask:* For web application integration
* *HTML and CSS:* For web pages creation and styling

## Repository Structure

* `labels.csv`: Includes all class labels.
* `templates/`: Contains HTML files for the web application.
* `static/`: Contains CSS files for styling the web application.
* `app.py`: Flask script for web application integration.
* `traffic_sign_recognition.py`: Script for training the CNN model and recognizing traffic signs.
* `my_model.h5`: Trained model.
* `README.md`: This file.
